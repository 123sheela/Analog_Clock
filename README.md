## Overview 

This project aims to create a simple analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The analog clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands.

 It's a great way to practice front-end web development skills and understand basic concepts of DOM manipulation and time handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- Hour, minute, and second hands to display the current time.
- Smooth rotation animation to simulate the movement of the hands.
- Clear and minimalistic design for easy readability.
  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML :** Markup language for structuring the elements of the clock.
- **CSS :** Styling language used for defining the appearance of the clock.
- **JavaScript :** Programming language used for implementing the clock functionality, such as retrieving the current time and updating the clock hands' positions.

## Future Improvements

- Add functionality to customize the clock appearance, such as changing the clock face color or the style of the hands.
- Implement additional features like time zone support or a digital time display.
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability.
